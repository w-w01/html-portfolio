<h1>My favorite movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Coffin in the Mountain</h3>
<p>
  The Chinese version of the movie title is actually "the Maze in the Heart". It
  is the first movie of the director Yukun Xin, and he only used the
  unprofessional actors to minimize the cost. But the actors are amazing! It's
  also the highest graded Chinese movie in 2015.

<h3>To Live</h3>
<p>
  The movie is adapted from Chinese writer Hua Yu's novel "To Live". Great
  director! Great casting! And it can't be seen in China mainland now because
  the story is so truthful and brutal.

<h3>I can't think of the third one right now so that's it.</h3>
